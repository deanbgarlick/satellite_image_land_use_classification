A small dockerized repo to containing jupyter notebooks for the training and inference of an image classification model on the University of California Merced's satellite image land use classification dataset: http://weegee.vision.ucmerced.edu/datasets/landuse.html .

The training notebook in this repo implements transfer learning on pytorch's pretrained resnet50.

The training/inference code is rather vanilla and much is copied from https://github.com/cfotache/pytorch_imageclassifier .
